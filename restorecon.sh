# Parallel SELinux Relabeling Script (V2 - Filesystem Boundary Aware)
# ==============================================================================
# Description:
# This script speeds up SELinux file context relabeling by running multiple
# 'restorecon' processes in parallel.
#
# KEY IMPROVEMENT (V2):
# Uses the '-x' flag with 'restorecon' to prevent crossing filesystem
# boundaries. This solves the redundancy problem where the job for the root
# filesystem ('/') would descend into and relabel other filesystems (/home,
# /var, etc.) that already have their own dedicated relabeling jobs.
#
# Logic:
# 1. Checks for root privileges and 'permissive' SELinux mode.
# 2. Determines the optimal number of parallel jobs based on available CPU cores.
# 3. Identifies all mounted, physical filesystems (xfs, ext4, btrfs, etc.).
# 4. For each filesystem, launches a 'restorecon -R -x' job, ensuring each job
#    stays within its assigned filesystem.
# 5. Manages all jobs in a pool to not exceed the CPU core limit.
